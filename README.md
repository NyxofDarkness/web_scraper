## Making a Web Scraper

[x]  Scrape a Wikipedia page and record which passages need citations.
> E.g. History of Mexico has 7 “citation needed” cases, as of this writing.
[x] Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed.
[x] Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage.
> E.g. Citation needed for “lorem spam and impsum eggs”
> Consider the “relevant passage” to be the parent element that contains the passage, often a paragraph element.
